# Numalogic


Numalogic is a collection of ML models and algorithms for real-time data analytics and AIOps including anomaly detection.

Numalogic can be installed as a library and used to build end-to-end ML pipelines. For streaming real time data processing, it can also be paired with our steaming data platform [Numaflow](https://numaflow.numaproj.io/).

## Key Features

1. Ease of use: simple and efficient tools for predictive data analytics
2. Reusability: all the functionalities can be re-used in various contexts
3. Model selection: easy to compare, validate, fine-tune and choose the model that works best with each data set
4. Data processing: readily available feature extraction, scaling, transforming and normalization tools
5. Extensibility: adding your own functions or extending over the existing capabilities
6. Model Storage: out-of-the-box support for MLFlow and support for other model ML lifecycle management tools

## Use Cases
1. Deployment failure detection
2. System failure detection for node failures or crashes
3. Fraud detection
4. Network intrusion detection
5. Forecasting on time series data

## Getting Started
