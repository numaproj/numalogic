## Benchmarks

This section contains some benchmarking results of numalogic's algorithms on real as well
synthetic data. Datasets here are publicly available from their respective repositories.

Note that efforts have not really been made on hyperparameter tuning. This is just to give users an
idea on how each algorithm is suitable for different kinds of data, and shows how they can do
their own benchmarking too.

This is an ongoing process, and we will add more benchmarking results in the near future.
